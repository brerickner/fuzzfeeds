## Hardware Components Used For This Project
*  Adafruit Feather HUZZAH
*  RaspberryPi
*  Breakout GPS board

## Hardware Requirements
A IoT device known as a microcontroller(eg. raspberryPi or Arduino Feather Huzzah) that has WiFi capabilities in addition to a breakout GPS chip for collectiong coordinates.

Make sure device is turned on.


## Software Requirements
1.  RaspberryPi locally ---> Python <i>connection</i> script.
2.  Registered ThingSpeak account for API access.


## Usage
*  Assign preferences in ThingSpeak allowing POST request to be made to Twitter on your behalf.
*  Customize what data is collected and the responses made to the specified data collected.
